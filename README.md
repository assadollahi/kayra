- can walk nearly as fast as a human toddler
- can use the arms to lift at least a toy
- works immediately after building it (walking, grabbing movement patterns provided)
- is easy to charge / batteries easy to change
- can be operated by a variety of controllers (Arduino, ESP-32, etc)
- can also be controlled via a remote control (PS2, 8Bitdo)
- design should be adaptable to different servos
- modular so that enthusiasts can change the design of a subsystem
- is easy to print and to build
- easy to write software for
- costs for a minimal system should be low
