- goal: can walk nearly as fast as a human toddler
- goal: it can use the arms to lift at least a toy
- works immediately after building it (walking, grabbing movement patterns provided)
- is easy to charge / batteries easy to change
- can be operated by a variety of controllers (Arduino, ESP-32, etc)
- option: can also be controlled via a remote control (PS2, 8Bitdo)
- is connected to a host for Machine Learning / Computer Vision
- design should be adaptable to different servos
- modular so that enthusiasts can change the design of a subsystem
- is easy to 3D print and to assemble, ideally no soldering necessary
- easy to write software for (Python on host, Micropython on controllers)
- costs for a minimal system should be low
